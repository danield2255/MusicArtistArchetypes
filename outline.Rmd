* Plot data on first 2-4 PCs, how does clustering look?

If there's PCA result you like, pick 2 dimensions and throw k-means.

Follow up with artists dataset, see cluster saturation with

* Gender

* Solo/Group

* Year?  Awards?  etc

## dbscan

* See if you can run it on a couple dimensions

* If finished, same followups
